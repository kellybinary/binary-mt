                <ol>
                    <li>Upon your request and consent, we may convert your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to a Swap-free Account. You acknowledge that we reserve the right to request justification, documents, and / or additional information in relation to your conversion request prior to the conversion. You also acknowledge that all open positions under your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to be converted to a Swap-Free Account must be closed prior to you accessing the Swap-free Account.

This means that we will not credit interest (interest income to you) of any form in respect of your Swap-free Account.

You agree and acknowledge that the execution, delivery and performance of your Swap-free Account is in accordance with the terms, characteristics and features as determined by us and may not conform with your corresponding Sharia principles and requirements.</li>
                    <li>The provision of Swap-free Accounts by us to you is made in good faith. By requesting and consenting to convert your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to a Swap-free Account, you represent and warrant to us that you will not take any unfair advantage of its terms or to enter into Transactions that take advantage of the differences between Swap-free Accounts and non-Swap-free Accounts (which can be a Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account). In the event that we detect any form of abuse, fraud, manipulation, or any other forms of deceitful activity in regards to your Swap-free Account, we may, at our absolute discretion:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>revoke the Swap-free status and convert your Swap-free Account to a non-Swap-free Account;</li>

                        <li>adjust (either by debiting or crediting your account) any un-accrued interest charges (due from you to us) or income (due from us to you) in relation to your Swap-free Account.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>

    <h2>六、订单</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Order Execution/Cancellation/Modification
            <ol>
                <li>您确认在向我们下订单前对订单功能、特点、条款和条件以及执行订单的影响充分了解是您的责任。</li>
                <li>Subject to network latency, we endeavour to execute your Order within a reasonable time from the time you triggered the Order, at the Price nearest to your specified Price. We do not guarantee that a Transaction will be opened/closed following an Order being triggered by you at your specified Price, stop level, or limit order level.</li>
                <li>We endeavour to open or close the Transaction to which your Order relates at the price reasonably available to us, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution. Best execution means that we must take all sufficient steps to obtain, when executing orders, the best possible result for you, taking into account the price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature, or any other consideration relevant to the execution of the order.</li>
                <li>Our Prices are determined by reference to the price of the underlying instrument which is quoted on external exchanges or dealing facilities that we select at our discretion. Our IT infrastructure and price aggregator system facilitates the reception of quotes from shortlisted prime brokers who act as liquidity providers for us and the delivery of the quotes, derived with reference against relevant benchmark and markets, to you. You acknowledge that our Prices may differ from the bid and offer prices made available by external exchanges or dealing facilities and we are not liable for any losses that you incur arising from such differences. This clause does not apply to Volatility Indices.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Order Types
            <ol>
                <li>We may, at our absolute discretion, accept and Order from you. Example of Orders offered currently:

                <ol>
                    <li>Market Orders &ndash; Market orders are instructions to deal now in your specified volume at spot price. When you execute a market order, your market order transaction becomes and Open Position which is subject to market fluctuations that occur between the time your market order is received/executed and the time your market order is filled. This means that your market order will be filled at the first available price that may be different from the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your market order on the electronic trading platform. By placing a Market order with us, you acknowledge that you are placing an instruction to open/close a Transaction regardless of the bid/offer price.</li>
                    <li>Pending Orders &ndash; Pending orders are instructions to deal when your pre-defined conditions, for example, bid/offer price, are fulfilled. Pending orders are filled at the first available price which may be the same as the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your market order on the electronic trading platform, or a few pips away due to slippage. You acknowledge that your pending order is triggered only if your pre-defined conditions attached to your pending order are fulfilled. This means that your pending order will not be filled if your pre-defined conditions attached to your pending orders are not fulfilled and you can skip a Transaction entirely. You can change your pre-defined conditions any time before your pending orders are filled.</li>
                    <li>Stop Orders &ndash; Stop orders are instructions to deal by opening or closing a Transaction when our quote reaches a level that is less favourable to you when compared against the current market price. By placing a stop order, you acknowledge that you are specifying a stop level and your stop order will be triggered if our bid/offer price moves against your favour to a point that it at or beyond your specified stop level. There are two types of stop order, stop closing order and stop entry order. A stop closing order is used to automatically close and Open Position when the market price reaches your specified stop level to limit your downside risk (a loss to you). A stop entry order is used to automatically open a position when the market price reaches your specified stop level to increase the probability of a profit to you.</li>
                    <li>Limit Orders &ndash; Limit orders operate on a rationale that is the opposite of stop orders. Limit orders are instructions to deal by opening or closing a Transaction when our quote reaches a level that is more favourable to you when compared against the current market price. By placing a limit order, you acknowledge that you are specifying a limit and your limit order will be triggered if our bid/offer price moves in your favour to a point that it at or beyond your specified limit. The limit order level is the maximum offer price at which you are willing to place an order to buy or the minimum at which you are willing to place an order to sell.</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Whilst we endeavour to explain how an Order operates through the content on Champion-FX.com, you acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to understand how an Order operates on the MT5 trading platform prior to placing any such Order with us.</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>您可以指定您的止损或限价订单指示可用于有限或无限期限（"取消前有效订单"或"GTC"订单）。</li>
        <li>In the case of a Stop Order, you acknowledge that we will endeavour to open/close a Transaction at the First Available Price.</li>
        <li>In the case of a Limit Order, you acknowledge that we will endeavour to open/close a Transaction at a level that is the same or better than the limit order level you specified, subject to the availability of the Limit Price. You acknowledge that at the time of order execution, our bid/offer price may become less favourable to you.</li>
        <li>一旦已经达到订单止损和限价水平，您不能在收盘交易前取消或修改止损和限价水平。</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that a Stop or Limit Order placed on your Open Position, when executed, would be capable of closing or partly closing your Transaction. You also acknowledge that it is your responsibility to cancel the Stop or Limit Order that you placed on your Open Positions if you do not want the Stop or Limit Order to remain valid. If you close your original Transaction and fail to cancel the Stop or Limit Order, we shall be entitled, at our absolute discretion, to treat the Stop or Limit Order as an instruction to enter into a new Transaction for you if and when our quote reaches or goes beyond the level of the Stop or Limit Order.</li>
        <li>您确认我们保留建立最小和最大交易额并可作出更改的权利， 以及我们仅执行在最小和最大交易金额范围内的订单。</li>
        <li>When Gapping occurs, we will seek to open or close the Transaction to which your Order relates, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution. You acknowledge that when gapping occurs in the underlying instrument on which your margin trading product is based, the time and level (the bid/offer price) at which your accepted order will be executed, may have a regard to the volume of your Order, the liquidity and volatility of the market of the underlying instrument on which your margin trading product is based, the sequence of your Order, and possible network latency. We will endeavour to fill/partially fill your Order within a reasonable time at the First Available Price after the gap has been filled.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that you will factor the following liquidity risks into any of your trading decision on Champion-FX.com during low liquidity levels of the market of the underlying instrument on which your margin trading product is based:
        <ol>
            <li>Difficulty to open or close a Transaction at the level (the bid/offer price) you requested;</li>
            <li>Delays in execution while a counterparty for your Transaction is identified;</li>
            <li>Differences in the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your order on the electronic trading platform and when your order is filled; and</li>
            <li>Wider bid-offer spread due to the decrease in the probability that the highest price any buyer is prepared to pay and the lowest price any seller is happy to accept will move closer together.</li>
        </ol>
            You acknowledge that during low liquidity levels, your orders may be filled at the first available price which may be the same as the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your market order on the electronic trading platform, or a few pips away due to slippage.
            </li>
        <li>We may, at our absolute discretion, disregard your Order if an Event takes place resulting in it no longer being reasonable for us to act on your Order after indicating an acceptance of your Order.</li>

                <li>整个交易期间以及交易开放期间， 您需要保持足够的账户资金，以支付任何保证金要求。如果您的账户资金在想要建立交易时低于开放交易保证金要求，您将收到追加保证金通知，需要立即补充短缺的资金。在补足短缺资金，拥有足够支付保证金的账户资金前您不能下单开启交易。</li>

            <ol>
                <li>保证金要求是未平仓头寸价值的百分比，并将在整个相关合约（"合约价值"） 期间继续根据未平仓头寸价值波动。</li>

                <li>我们可能会自行决定为任何未平仓头寸或新签订交易修改保证金要求。网站上公布的保证金要求公式仅供参考用途，并可能会随时因市场条件或其他因素的变化由公司自行决定更改。</li>
                <li>Whilst we endeavour to close out your Open Positions if and when the Margin Level for your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, we do not guarantee that your Open Positions will be closed when the Margin Level for your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account reaches the Stop Out Level.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>如果您真实账户的保证金水平达到或低于强制平仓水平，将被归类为默认事件。在这种情况下，未平仓头寸将按照以下顺序自动平仓: (i) 服务器分析当前没在执行的客户订单;（ii） 服务器删除保证金最高的订单;（iii） 如果您的保证金水平仍然低于强制平仓水平，下一个订单将被删除 （没有保证金要求的订单不会被删除）;（iv）如果您的保证金水平仍然低于强制平仓水平，服务器将亏损最大的头寸平仓;（v） 未平仓头寸将强制平仓，直到您的保证金水平高于强制平仓水平。</li>
                <li>我们在网站上公布适用于您账户的默认强制平仓水平。然而，我们有绝对自由裁量权更改默认强制平仓水平。对强制平仓水平进行的任何更改将立即生效。我们将努力通过在我们的网站上发布修改后的默认强制平仓水平通知您已经更改默认强制平仓水平。定期查看我们的网站，并了解默认强制平仓水平是您的责任。</li>

    <h2>风险披露声明</h2>
    <p>此风险披露声明并非详尽无遗，也并非包含您可能会接触到的所有风险的全面声明。此声明也并不能描述外汇交易和合约现存的固有风险或将来可能发生的所有风险差异。其目的在于为您提供及让您合理理解Binary.com在符合我们利益的同时为您提供的最佳外汇与差价合约交易经验相关的风险信息。</p>

    <h2>外汇和差价交易合约涉及高风险，是一种投机活动</h2>
    <p>外汇和差价交易合约涉及高风险，是一种投机活动，因为您可推测基础金融工具价格的短期变动。除非您能接受比您存入资金更大的亏损，不然您不适合参与外汇交易和 （或） 签订差价交易合约。重要的是您需了解，如果要从持仓头寸获取任何回报，您必须参与相应的交易将持仓头寸平仓，有时候在一些市场条件下您可能很难或无法做到此点。</p>

    <h2>执行模型和交易对手风险</h2>
    <p>Binary.com通过混合模式提供外汇和差价合约，即通过自己的账户（交易员）和部分对冲客户订单与我们的流动率提供商（无交易员）进行交易。当总交易量超过预定的风险承受力水平限额时，客户订单通常被对冲。Binary.com在两种执行模式中都扮演您与我们签订交易的合约相对方，而不是像交易所的交易金融工具那样与中央结算所订立交易的合约相对方。 因此，存在相对方风险。 相对方风险是指客户因为您签订的外汇和/或差价交易合约相对方在交易现金流最终结算前违反其义务而造成的损失风险。</p>

    <h2>杠杆</h2>
    <p>融资融券交易中，杠杆指使用保证金增加/扩大交易数值。杠杆的表达方式是比率。举个例子，如果杠杆是50: 1，您将能够持有比保证金高出 50 倍的交易头寸。当您投资一种杠杆产品时，您的盈利或亏损将根据杠杆的头寸计算，也就是说，您为账户设置的杠杆比率决定了您的交易增加/扩大数值。</p>
    <p>杠杆可以用于生成比从您的账户余额拨出进行开盘持仓交易（您的保证金）的金额高出多倍的回报。然而，进行可能带来更大投资回报的投资具更高风险。这意味着，如果价格走势对您不利，您将蒙受比从您的账户余额拨出进行开盘持仓交易（您的保证金）的金额高出多倍的亏损。</p>
    <p>如果您不打算使用杠杆功能，请将杠杆比率设为 1:1。</p>

    <h2>保证金与杠杆之间的关系</h2>
    <p>杠杆比率指使用您的保证金（为进行交易从您的账户余额拨出并保留的金额） 作为"杠杆"进入交易的次数。杠杆比率的分母始终是 1。50: 1 的杠杆比率相当于需要 2%保证金 (1 除以 50 = 2%)。我们替您建立的杠杆比率将确定保证金的数额。杠杆比率与保证金成反比，您的账户所设杠杆比率越低，从您的账户余额拨出的保证金额就越高 （所需保证金）。</p>

    <h2>止损单的风险</h2>
    <p>系统按先进先出的次序，即按照收到订单的顺序处理订单，这是我们无法控制的。因此，您可能会发现很难或无法在某些市场条件下按照您的止损单规定的预期价位平仓。您设定的止损单虽然是有用的风险管理工具，却不一定能按照您原先设想的数额限制损失。在极不稳定的交易条件下，由于市场情况可能无法执行这些指令，您的退出价格具不确定性。简而言之，止损单是无法提供保证的，因为无法在所有市场情况下运作。</p>

    <h2>定期监测未平仓头寸</h2>
    <p>外汇和差价合约交易有很高的风险，Binary.com不会代表您监控您账户上的未平仓头寸。监控未平仓头寸和理解未平仓头寸所牵涉的风险，同时确保此牵涉风险与您的风险偏好相符是您的责任。由于隔夜未平仓头寸具相关费用，您应该考虑在您平常进行的工具投资市场中交易，而不是在差价合约市场中投资。</p>

    <h2>滑点风险</h2>
    <p>虽然我们将按照最佳执行职责行事，致力以要求价格对您的订单涉及交易进行开盘或收盘，但有时订单可能会由于波动率或交易量增加而受滑移。交易完成时订单价格和执行价格的区别被称为滑移。这意味着当您下订单时，您的订单没有依照确切的预期报价完成交易。滑移通常发生在股市波动率非常高或低的期间以及重大新闻发布期间或流动性有限的时期。滑移可分为正滑移 （对您较有利） 或负滑移 （对您不利）。</p>

    <h2>外部力量</h2>
    <p>您与 Binary.com的外汇和差价合约交易与一种标的金融工具相连接，您将承受与金融工具有关的价格、汇率、利率或其他市场波动率的风险，特别是如果市场所属的管辖权与你无关。通过电子交易平台在网络上进行的外汇和差价合约交易承受潜在数据风险，可能导致订单执行的延误。</p>

    <h2>四、客户的指示</h2>
        <p>当我们收到您给的开盘或收盘交易订单或任何其他关于订单的具体指示，我们会努力尽可能合理地遵照您的指示并根据我们最佳执行责任行事。这些具体的指示包括，但不限于︰</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a) 您的订单执行地点;</li>
            <li>b）您的订单执行价格;</li>
            <li>c) 您的订单执行时间;</li>

        </ul>
        <p>如您在执行订单相关指示中指定了特定场地，我们不对场地选择负责。</p>
        <p>如客户在执行订单指示中指定了时间或时间周期，不论是否有可用价格，我们将在采取所有足够步骤后努力在指定时间或时间周期内尽可能以最佳方式执行订单。然而，我们不对因执行时间或时间周期而引起价格相关的任何后果负责。</p>
        <p>不受具体指示影响的客户订单相关事宜必须符合Binary.com订单执行政策的使用需求。客户没有提供具体指示时，为了向您提供最佳执行措施，我们将根据以下执行标准自行确定所需要考虑的因素：</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>客户的特性;</li>
            <li>订单的特点;</li>
            <li>属于订单主题的金融工具特点；</li>
            <li class="no-bullet">和</li>
            <li>可以将订单导入的执行场地特点。</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>五、最佳执行义务</h2>
        <p>当我们代替您执行订单时，也就是说，当您依法托付我们执行您的订单并维护您的利益时，Binary.com 有义务以最佳方式执行。</p>
        <p>代您执行订单时，为了替您争取最佳成果，Binary.com 将考虑以下各点︰</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>价格 - 您的订单相关的交易执行价格。</li>
            <li>费用 - 您的订单执行费用主要由价差，即我们的标价和我们提供的价格之间的区别组成。</li>
            <li>速度 - 您的订单可执行速度。</li>
            <li>执行和结算可能性 - 您的订单相关的市场流动性深度。</li>
            <li>大小 - 您的订单大小根据数量 （手数） 而定。</li>
            <li>任何其他与交易执行相关的事项。</li>
        </ul>
        <p>上面列出的因素不是按照优先次序排列。一般情况下，为您获得最佳结果时将把价格列为相对比较重要的项目。然而，上述所列因素的相对重要性可能会基于以下各点而更改：</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>您所提供的特定指令；</li>
            <li>与您的订单有关的金融工具市场条件，其中包括及时执行需求、价格优化的可行性、市场流动性、订单大小、以及对总数值的潜在影响。</li>
        </ul>
        <p>在某些情况下，我们所决心的执行因素相对重要性可能与您的不相同。我们根据最佳执行义务操作，为您争取最大利益。</p>

    <h2>六、执行场地</h2>
        <p>Binary.com通过混合模式提供外汇和差价合约，即通过自己的账户（交易员）和部分对冲客户订单与我们的流动率提供商（无交易员）进行交易。</p>
        <p>当我们在自己账户（交易平台）上交易时，我们是委托人，而不是您的代理人，因此我们是执行场地。</p>
        <p>作为您的订单委托人，我们也对我们高度依赖的执行场地进行评估，以便为您的订单执行提供最佳效益。这些场地通常由第三方投资公司、经纪人和/或流动性提供商组成。</p>
        <p>为使我们的最佳执行义务能让您实现更佳成果，Binary.com 定期评估外部执行场地选项（每年至少一次） 。</p>

    <h2>七、订单处理</h2>
        <p>所有客户订单将以先进先出，没有任何人工干预的方式处理。执行您的订单时，Binary.com 将尽快以指示价格 （或可用的更佳价格）填补您的订单交易记录。基于内部治理安排和风险管理框架建立的接触限值将与我们活动的大小、性质、复杂性和风险架构相配合。这些接触限值是区分自动接受订单和可用于将填补水平传递给客户端市场的订单的基准。</p>

    <h2>八、监测和审查</h2>
        <p>我们将监督订单的执行安排和政策的有效性。我们会定期评估，看我们代表您进行合约交易的报价地点能否持续保证我们获得最佳执行方案，从而决定我们是否要更改执行安排。我们也将对订单执行安排和策略的更改进行监督，评估报价地点及其他因素是否会影响我们持续获得最佳执行方案。当订单执行安排和政策发生重大变更时，我们会通知您。</p>

    <h2>附录 - 产品具体政策</h2>

    <h2>一、现货外汇</h2>
        <p>关于Binary.com 提供的Spot FX 特点和交易说明，请参阅产品披露声明。这项政策是Binary.com 综合性订单执行政策的附录，须与 Binary.com 综合性订单执行政策一起阅读。</p>
        <p>Binary.com在管理传入订单时通过采用智能聚合方法为您提供最佳执行方案。智能聚合方法的工作原理是︰</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>将数个供应商集合成单股混合输入，以加强流动性; 和</li>
            <li>根据以最佳执行因素建立的配置和算法将传入的订单通过智能路由归纳成不同类型的执行模式。</li>
        </ul>
        <p>默认情况下，智能订单路由系统确保记录本的最顶部位总是由最佳竞标价格和参与竞争的流动性提供商报价组成。然而，在市场流动性不足的时候，这种情况可能会改变，并由执行可能性作主要执行因素。</p>
        <p>基于我们作为您的交易相对方所接触的风险水平，我们在您的交易中参与大部分的主要活动。因此，执行场所通常是在Binary.com。然而，我们可能会将您的订单转给第三方流动性提供商。在这种情况下，我们将根据以上所述自行确定执行场所。</p>
        <p>我们定期对执行场地进行评估，确保能为客户提供最佳可能结果。</p>
