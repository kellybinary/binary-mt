            <h2>What is Margin?</h2>
            <p>Margin allows you to trade on leverage, giving you the same level of market exposure using much less capital.</p>
            <div class="mt-box gr-12">
                <p class="mt-box-header">For example:</p>
                <p class="mt-box-content">If you wanted to purchase <strong>100 units</strong> of a particular asset trading at <strong>US&#36; 50 per unit</strong> through a traditional broker, it would cost you <strong>US&#36; 5,000</strong> for this transaction.</p>
            </div>
            <p>With a CFD or leveraged FX trading, you can purchase 100 units of the same asset at a fraction of the cost.</p>

                <div class="mt-img l1-icon"></div>
                <p class="mt-box-header">For example:</p>
                <p class="mt-box-content">If you buy <strong>1 Volume of Volatility 100 Index</strong> at a <strong>price of US&#36 20,000</strong> and a <strong>margin rate of 0.01(1%)</strong>, the margin required to purchase that one lot will be calculated as follows:</p>

            <h2>What’s a margin call and how do we apply it?</h2>
            <p>When your account equity is unable to cover the margin requirement, your account will be placed under margin call. This state does not affect your ability to open new positions. You can deposit additional funds to prevent the margin call escalating to a stop out level.</p>

            <h2>What’s a stop out level and how do we apply it?</h2>
            <p>If your account is placed under margin call for an extended period of time, it will reach the stop out level where it’s unable to sustain an open position. This will lead to your pending orders being deleted, and open positions being forcibly closed (also known as forced liquidation).</p>

                        <li>If your margin level is still under the stop out level, we will close an open position with the largest loss.</li>
