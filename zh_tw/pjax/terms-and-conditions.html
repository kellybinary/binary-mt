                    <li>in the case of a client breaching any of the terms of this Agreement which results in a negative balance.</li>

                        <li>Your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account password and login ID are unique and passwords are hashed so that not even Binary.com staff can read them.

Your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account may be closed if you do not have any Open Positions and all amounts due to us have been settled.</li>
                <li>Swap-free Account</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Upon your request and consent, we may convert your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to a Swap-free Account. You acknowledge that we reserve the right to request justification, documents, and / or additional information in relation to your conversion request prior to the conversion. You also acknowledge that all open positions under your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to be converted to a Swap-free Account must be closed prior to you accessing the Swap-free Account. We may, acting reasonably, accept or reject your conversion request at our sole discretion for any reason whatsoever without being obliged to provide any explanation or justification.</li>
                    <li>Upon converting your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to a Swap-free Account, you acknowledge and agree that no interest adjustment (or swap rate adjustment) will be made to your Swap-free Account when rolling over your Open Positions. This means that we will not debit interest (interest charge to you) of any form in respect of your Swap-free Account; likewise, by requesting and consenting the conversion to a Swap-free Account, you acknowledge and agree that you are waiving your entitlement to receive interest in respect of your Swap-free Account. This means that we will not credit interest (interest income to you) of any form in respect of your Swap-free Account.
</li>
                    <li>We will take all reasonable steps to provide you with the features and facilities of a Swap-free Account. The interest-free arrangements in place in relation to your Swap-free Account does not warrant or represent (whether express or implied) that your Swap-free Account is Sharia-compliant. You agree and acknowledge that the execution, delivery and performance of your Swap-free Account is in accordance with the terms, characteristics and features as determined by us and may not conform with your corresponding Sharia principles and requirements.</li>
                    <li>The provision of Swap-free Accounts by us to you is made in good faith. By requesting and consenting to convert your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account designated by you to a Swap-free Account, you represent and warrant to us that you will not take any unfair advantage of its terms or to enter into Transactions that take advantage of the differences between Swap-free Accounts and non-Swap-free Accounts (which can be a Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account). In the event that we detect any form of abuse, fraud, manipulation, or any other forms of deceitful activity in regards to your Swap-free Account, we may, at our absolute discretion:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>revoke the Swap-free status and convert your Swap-free Account to a non-Swap-free Account;</li>
                        <li>treat all your Transactions closed under your Swap-free Account as void and nullify all profits generated or losses incurred in relation to your Swap-free Account; and</li>
                        <li>adjust (either by debiting or crediting your account) any un-accrued interest charges (due from you to us) or income (due from us to you) in relation to your Swap-free Account.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>六、訂單</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Order Execution/Cancellation/Modification
            <ol>
                <li>您確認在向我們下訂單前對訂單功能、特點、條款和條件以及執行訂單的影響充分了解是您的責任。</li>
                <li>Subject to network latency, we endeavour to execute your Order within a reasonable time from the time you triggered the Order, at the Price nearest to your specified Price. We do not guarantee that a Transaction will be opened/closed following an Order being triggered by you at your specified Price, stop level, or limit order level.</li>
                <li>We endeavour to open or close the Transaction to which your Order relates at the price reasonably available to us, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution. Best execution means that we must take all sufficient steps to obtain, when executing orders, the best possible result for you, taking into account the price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature, or any other consideration relevant to the execution of the order.</li>
                <li>Our Prices are determined by reference to the price of the underlying instrument which is quoted on external exchanges or dealing facilities that we select at our discretion. Our IT infrastructure and price aggregator system facilitates the reception of quotes from shortlisted prime brokers who act as liquidity providers for us and the delivery of the quotes, derived with reference against relevant benchmark and markets, to you. You acknowledge that our Prices may differ from the bid and offer prices made available by external exchanges or dealing facilities and we are not liable for any losses that you incur arising from such differences. This clause does not apply to Volatility Indices.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Order Types
            <ol>
                <li>We may, at our absolute discretion, accept and Order from you. Example of Orders offered currently:

                <ol>
                    <li>Market Orders &ndash; Market orders are instructions to deal now in your specified volume at spot price. When you execute a market order, your market order transaction becomes and Open Position which is subject to market fluctuations that occur between the time your market order is received/executed and the time your market order is filled. This means that your market order will be filled at the first available price that may be different from the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your market order on the electronic trading platform. By placing a Market order with us, you acknowledge that you are placing an instruction to open/close a Transaction regardless of the bid/offer price.</li>
                    <li>Pending Orders &ndash; Pending orders are instructions to deal when your pre-defined conditions, for example, bid/offer price, are fulfilled. Pending orders are filled at the first available price which may be the same as the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your market order on the electronic trading platform, or a few pips away due to slippage. You acknowledge that your pending order is triggered only if your pre-defined conditions attached to your pending order are fulfilled. This means that your pending order will not be filled if your pre-defined conditions attached to your pending orders are not fulfilled and you can skip a Transaction entirely. You can change your pre-defined conditions any time before your pending orders are filled.</li>
                    <li>Stop Orders &ndash; Stop orders are instructions to deal by opening or closing a Transaction when our quote reaches a level that is less favourable to you when compared against the current market price. By placing a stop order, you acknowledge that you are specifying a stop level and your stop order will be triggered if our bid/offer price moves against your favour to a point that it at or beyond your specified stop level. There are two types of stop order, stop closing order and stop entry order. A stop closing order is used to automatically close and Open Position when the market price reaches your specified stop level to limit your downside risk (a loss to you). A stop entry order is used to automatically open a position when the market price reaches your specified stop level to increase the probability of a profit to you.</li>
                    <li>Limit Orders &ndash; Limit orders operate on a rationale that is the opposite of stop orders. Limit orders are instructions to deal by opening or closing a Transaction when our quote reaches a level that is more favourable to you when compared against the current market price. By placing a limit order, you acknowledge that you are specifying a limit and your limit order will be triggered if our bid/offer price moves in your favour to a point that it at or beyond your specified limit. The limit order level is the maximum offer price at which you are willing to place an order to buy or the minimum at which you are willing to place an order to sell.</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Whilst we endeavour to explain how an Order operates through the content on Binary.com, you acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to understand how an Order operates on the MT5 trading platform prior to placing any such Order with us.</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>您可以指定您的止損或限價訂單指示可用於有限或無限期限（「取消前有效訂單」或「GTC」訂單）。</li>
        <li>In the case of a Stop Order, you acknowledge that we will endeavour to open/close a Transaction at the First Available Price.</li>
        <li>In the case of a Limit Order, you acknowledge that we will endeavour to open/close a Transaction at a level that is the same or better than the limit order level you specified, subject to the availability of the Limit Price. You acknowledge that at the time of order execution, our bid/offer price may become less favourable to you.</li>
        <li>一旦已經達到訂單止損和限價水平，您不能在收盤交易前取消或修改止損和限價水平。</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that a Stop or Limit Order placed on your Open Position, when executed, would be capable of closing or partly closing your Transaction. You also acknowledge that it is your responsibility to cancel the Stop or Limit Order that you placed on your Open Positions if you do not want the Stop or Limit Order to remain valid. If you close your original Transaction and fail to cancel the Stop or Limit Order, we shall be entitled, at our absolute discretion, to treat the Stop or Limit Order as an instruction to enter into a new Transaction for you if and when our quote reaches or goes beyond the level of the Stop or Limit Order.</li>
        <li>您確認我們保留建立最小和最大交易額並可作出更改的權利， 以及我們僅執行在最小和最大交易金額範圍內的訂單。</li>
        <li>When Gapping occurs, we will seek to open or close the Transaction to which your Order relates, acting in accordance with our duty of best execution. You acknowledge that when gapping occurs in the underlying instrument on which your margin trading product is based, the time and level (the bid/offer price) at which your accepted order will be executed, may have a regard to the volume of your Order, the liquidity and volatility of the market of the underlying instrument on which your margin trading product is based, the sequence of your Order, and possible network latency. We will endeavour to fill/partially fill your Order within a reasonable time at the First Available Price after the gap has been filled.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that you will factor the following liquidity risks into any of your trading decision on Binary.com during low liquidity levels of the market of the underlying instrument on which your margin trading product is based:
        <ol>
            <li>Difficulty to open or close a Transaction at the level (the bid/offer price) you requested;</li>
            <li>Delays in execution while a counterparty for your Transaction is identified;</li>
            <li>Differences in the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your order on the electronic trading platform and when your order is filled; and</li>
            <li>Wider bid-offer spread due to the decrease in the probability that the highest price any buyer is prepared to pay and the lowest price any seller is happy to accept will move closer together.</li>
        </ol>
            You acknowledge that during low liquidity levels, your orders may be filled at the First Available Price which may be the same as the quoted bid/offer price when you clicked to execute your market order on the electronic trading platform, or a few pips away due to slippage.
            </li>
        <li>We may, at our absolute discretion, disregard your Order if an Event takes place resulting in it no longer being reasonable for us to act on your Order after indicating an acceptance of your Order.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>七、保證金</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>一般規定
            <ol>
                <li>Prior to placing an Order which results in opening a Transaction or increasing an existing Open Position, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure that your Account's Free Margin is sufficient to cover the Margin required in relation to the open Transaction (the "Margin Requirement"), and to continuously meet the Margin Requirement.</li>
                <li>整個交易期間以及交易開放期間， 您需要保持足夠的帳戶資金，以支付任何保證金要求。如果您的帳戶資金在想要建立交易時低於開放交易保證金要求，您將收到追加保證金通知，需要立即補充短缺的資金。在補足短缺資金，擁有足夠支付保證金的帳戶資金前您不能下單開啟交易。</li>
                <li>您確認監控帳戶餘額和保證金要求是您的責任，我們沒有義務通知您 (例如追加保證金通知)。</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>保證金要求和計算
            <ol>
                <li>保證金要求是未平倉頭寸價值的百分比，並將在整個相關合約 （「合約價值」） 期間繼續根據未平倉頭寸價值波動。</li>
                <li>Margin Requirements can increase/decrease based on the aggregated size of your Open Position determined by the volume (number of lots), contract size (value per point in the original currency of the contract), market price, and margin rate.</li>
                <li>我們可能會自行決定為任何未平倉頭寸或新簽訂交易修改保證金要求。網站上公佈的保證金要求公式僅供參考用途，並可能會隨時因市場條件或其他因素的變化由公司自行決定更改。</li>
                <li>Whilst we endeavour to close out your Open Positions if and when the Margin Level for your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, we do not guarantee that your Open Positions will be closed when the Margin Level for your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account reaches the Stop Out Level.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>強制平倉層次
            <ol>
                <li>If the Margin Level for your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, this will be classified as an Event of Default. In such circumstances, Open Positions are automatically closed in the following order: (i) the server analyses clients' Orders that are not under execution at the moment; (ii) the server deletes Orders with the largest Margin; (iii) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the next order is deleted (orders without margin requirements are not deleted); (iv) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the server closes a position with the largest loss; (v) Open Positions are closed until your Margin Level becomes higher than the Stop Out Level.</li>
                <li>The default Stop Out Level applicable to your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account is published on our website. However, the default Stop Out Level is subject to alteration at our absolute discretion. Any changes to the Stop Out Level will take effect immediately. We will endeavour to notify you of an alteration to the default Stop Out Level by publishing the revised default Stop Out Level on our website. It is your responsibility to check our website regularly and remain informed about the default Stop Out Level.</li>
                <li>The Stop Out Level applicable to your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account may differ from the default Stop Out Level published on our website.</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>You may make Margin Payments by transferring funds from your Binary Options Real Account to your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account. In the event that there are insufficient funds in your Binary Options Real Account to fund your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account, you may make Margin Payments by funding your Binary Options Real Account and transferring the funds from your Binary Options Real Account to your Cent, Standard, and / or STP Account.</li>

    <h2>風險披露聲明</h2>
    <p>此風險披露聲明並非詳盡無遺，也並非包含您可能會接觸到的所有風險的全面聲明。此聲明也並不能描述外匯交易和合約現存的固有風險或將來可能發生的所有風險差異。其目的在於為您提供及讓您合理理解Binary.com在符合我們利益的同時為您提供的最佳外匯與差價合約交易經驗相關的風險資訊。</p>

    <h2>外匯和差價交易合約涉及高風險，是一種投機活動</h2>
    <p>外匯和差價交易合約涉及高風險，是一種投機活動，因為您可推測基礎金融工具價格的短期變動。除非您能接受比您存入資金更大的虧損，不然您不適合參與外匯交易和 （或） 簽訂差價交易合約。重要的是您需了解，如果要從持倉頭寸獲取任何回報，您必須參與相應的交易將持倉頭寸平倉，有時候在一些市場條件下您可能很難或無法做到此點。</p>

    <h2>執行模型和交易對手風險</h2>
    <p>Binary.com通過混合模式提供外匯和差價合約，即通過自己的帳戶（交易員）和部分對沖客戶訂單與我們的流動率提供商（無交易員）進行交易。當總交易量超過預定的風險承受力層次限額時，客戶訂單通常被對沖。Binary.com在兩種執行模式中都扮演您與我們簽訂交易的合約相對方，而不是像交易所的交易金融工具那樣與中央結算所訂立交易的合約相對方。因此，存在相對方風險。相對方風險是指客戶因為您簽訂的外匯和/或差價交易合約相對方在交易現金流最終結算前違反其義務而造成的損失風險。</p>

    <h2>槓桿</h2>
    <p>融資融券交易中，槓桿指使用保證金增加/擴大交易數值。槓桿的表達方式是比率。舉個例子，如果槓桿是50: 1，您將能夠持有比保證金高出 50 倍的交易頭寸。當您投資一種槓桿產品時，您的盈利或虧損將根據槓桿的頭寸計算，也就是說，您為帳戶設定的槓桿比率決定了您的交易增加/擴大數值。</p>
    <p>槓桿可以用於生成比從您的帳戶餘額撥出進行開盤持倉交易（您的保證金）的金額高出多倍的回報。然而，進行可能帶來更大投資回報的投資具更高風險。這意味著，如果價格走勢對您不利，您將蒙受比從您的帳戶餘額撥出進行開盤持倉交易（您的保證金）的金額高出多倍的虧損。</p>
    <p>如果您不打算使用槓桿功能，請將槓桿比率設為 1:1。</p>

    <h2>保證金與槓桿之間的關係</h2>
    <p>槓桿比率指使用您的保證金（為進行交易從您的帳戶餘額撥出並保留的金額） 作為"槓桿"進入交易的次數。槓桿比率的分母始終是 1。50: 1 的槓桿比率相當於需要 2%保證金 (1 除以 50 = 2%)。我們替您建立的槓桿比率將確定保證金的數額。槓桿比率與保證金成反比，您的帳戶所設槓桿比率越低，從您的帳戶餘額撥出的保證金額就越高 （所需保證金）。</p>

    <h2>止損單的風險</h2>
    <p>系統按先進先出的次序，即按照收到訂單的順序處理訂單，這是我們無法控制的。因此，您可能會發現很難或無法在某些市場條件下按照您的止損單規定的預期價位平倉。您設定的止損單雖然是有用的風險管理工具，卻不一定能按照您原先設想的數額限制損失。在極不穩定的交易條件下，由於市場情況可能無法執行這些指令，您的退出價格具不確定性。簡而言之，止損單是無法提供保證的，因為無法在所有市場情況下運作。</p>

    <h2>定期監測未平倉頭寸</h2>
    <p>外匯和差價合約交易有很高的風險，Binary.com不會代表您監控您帳戶上的未平倉頭寸。監控未平倉頭寸和理解未平倉頭寸所牽涉的風險，同時確保此牽涉風險與您的風險偏好相符是您的責任。由於隔夜未平倉頭寸具相關費用，您應該考慮在您平常進行的工具投資市場中交易，而不是在差價合約市場中投資。</p>

    <h2>滑點風險</h2>
    <p>雖然我們將按照最佳執行職責行事，致力以要求價格對您的訂單涉及交易進行開盤或收盤，但有時訂單可能會由於波動率或交易量增加而受滑移。交易完成時訂單價格和執行價格的區別被稱為滑移。這意味著當您下訂單時，您的訂單沒有依照確切的預期報價完成交易。滑移通常發生在股市波動率非常高或低的期間以及重大新聞發布期間或流動性有限的時期。滑移可分為正滑移 （對您較有利） 或負滑移 （對您不利）。</p>

    <h2>外部力量</h2>
    <p>您與Binary.com的外匯和差價合約交易與一種標的金融工具相連接，您將承受與金融工具有關的價格、匯率、利率或其他市場波動率的風險，特別是如果市場所屬的管轄權與你無關。通過電子交易平台在網路上進行的外匯和差價合約交易承受潛在資料風險，可能導致訂單執行的延誤。</p>

        <p>This Policy applies to retail and professional clients of Binary.com dealing in financial products offered by Binary.com.</p>

        <p>最佳執行方案是在執行訂單時為了確保您能獲得最佳成果所必須採取的足夠措施。須要考慮的因素包括價格、成本、速度、執行和結算的可能性、大小、性質或其他與訂單執行相關的任何考慮點（以下簡稱為「執行因素」）。</p>

    <h2>四、客戶的指示</h2>
        <p>當我們收到您給的開盤或收盤交易訂單或任何其他關於訂單的具體指示，我們會努力盡可能合理地遵照您的指示並根據我們最佳執行責任行事。這些具體的指示包括，但不限於︰</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a) 您的訂單執行地點;</li>
            <li>b）您的訂單執行價格;</li>
            <li>c）您的訂單執行時間;</li>
            <li>d）您的訂單執行所界定的時間範圍或合同期限。</li>
        </ul>
        <p>如您在執行訂單相關指示中指定了特定場地，我們不對場地選擇負責。</p>
        <p>如客戶在執行訂單指示中指定了時間或時間週期，不論是否有可用價格，我們將在採取所有足夠步驟後努力在指定時間或時間週期內盡可能以最佳方式執行訂單。然而，我們不對因執行時間或時間週期而引起價格相關的任何後果負責。</p>
        <p>不受具體指示影響的客戶訂單相關事宜必須符合Binary.com訂單執行政策的使用需求。客戶沒有提供具體指示時，為了向您提供最佳執行方案，我們將根據以下執行標準自行確定所需要考慮的因素：</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>客戶的特性;</li>
            <li>訂單的特點;</li>
            <li>屬於訂單主題的金融工具特點；</li>
            <li class="no-bullet">和</li>
            <li>可以將訂單導入的執行場地特點。</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>五、最佳執行義務</h2>
        <p>當我們代替您執行訂單時，也就是說，當您依法託付我們執行您的訂單並維護您的利益時，Binary.com 有義務以最佳方式執行。</p>
        <p>代您执行订单时，为了替您争取最佳成果，Binary.com 将考虑以下各点︰</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>價格 - 您的訂單相關的交易執行價格。</li>
            <li>費用 - 您的訂單執行費用主要由價差，即我們的標價和我們提供的價格之間的區別組成。</li>
            <li>速度 - 您的訂單可執行速度。</li>
            <li>執行和結算可能性 - 您的訂單相關的市場流動性深度。</li>
            <li>大小 - 您的訂單大小根據數量 （手數） 而定。</li>
            <li>任何其他與交易執行相關的事項。</li>
        </ul>
        <p>上面列出的因素不是按照優先次序排列。一般情況下，為您獲得最佳結果時將把價格列為相對比較重要的項目。然而，上述所列因素的相對重要性可能會基於以下各點而更改：</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>您所提供的特定指令；</li>
            <li>與您的訂單有關的金融工具市場條件，其中包括及時執行需求、價格優化的可行性、市場流動性、訂單大小、以及對總數值的潛在影響。</li>
        </ul>
        <p>在某些情況下，我們所決心的執行因素相對重要性可能與您的不相同。我們根據最佳執行義務操作，為您爭取最大利益。</p>

    <h2>六、執行場地</h2>
        <p>Binary.com 通過混合模式提供外匯和差價合約，即通過自己的帳戶（交易員）和部分對沖客戶訂單與我們的流動率提供商（無交易員）進行交易。</p>
        <p>當我們在自己帳戶（交易平台）上交易時，我們是委託人，而不是您的代理人，因此我們是執行場地。</p>
        <p>作為您的訂單委託人，我們也對我們高度依賴的執行場地進行評估，以便為您的訂單執行提供最佳效益。這些場地通常由第三方投資公司、經紀人和/或流動性提供商組成。</p>
        <p>為使我們的最佳執行義務能讓您實現更佳成果，Binary.com 定期評估外部執行場地選項（每年至少一次） 。</p>

    <h2>七、訂單處理</h2>
        <p>所有客戶訂單將以先進先出，沒有任何人工干預的方式處理。執行您的訂單時，Binary.com 將盡快以指示價格 （或更佳的可用價格）填補您的訂單交易記錄。基於內部治理安排和風險管理框架建立的接觸限值將與我們活動的大小、性質、複雜性和風險架構相配合。這些接觸限值是區分自動接受訂單和可用於將填補層次傳遞給客戶端市場的訂單的基準。</p>

    <h2>八、監測和審查</h2>
        <p>我們將會對我們的訂單執行安排和政策有效性進行監督。我們將定期評估：我們替您進行合約交易的報價區域是否達到最佳執行效果，以及我們是否需要對執行安排作出變更。我們會檢查所選的個報價區域或其他因素是否會影響持續獲得最佳執行方案的能力，也會檢查有關的訂單執行安排和重大政策變更。如果有任何訂單執行安排或政策之重大變更，我們會通知您。</p>

    <h2>附錄-產品特定政策</h2>

    <h2>一、現貨外匯</h2>
        <p>關於Binary.com 提供的Spot FX 特點和交易說明，請參閱產品披露聲明。這項政策是Binary.com 綜合性訂單執行政策的附錄，須與 Binary.com 綜合性訂單執行政策一起閱讀。</p>
        <p>Binary.com在管理傳入訂單時通過採用智慧型匯總方法為您提供最佳執行方案。智慧型匯總方法的工作原理是︰</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
            <li>將數個供應商集合成單股混合輸入，以加強流動性; 和</li>
            <li>根據以最佳執行因素建立的設定和算法將傳入的訂單通過智慧路由歸納成不同類型的執行模式。</li>
        </ul>
        <p>預設情況下，智慧型訂單路由系統確保記錄本的最頂部位總是由最佳競標價格和參與競爭的流動性提供商報價組成。然而，在市場流動性不足的時候，這種情況可能會改變，並由執行可能性作主要執行因素。</p>
        <p>基於我們作為您的交易相對方所接觸的風險層次，我們在您的交易中參與大部分的主要活動。因此，執行場所通常是在Binary.com。然而，我們可能會將您的訂單轉給第三方流動性提供商。在這種情況下，我們將根據以上所述自行確定執行場所。</p>
        <p>我們定期對執行場地進行評估，確保能為客戶提供最佳可能結果。</p>
